Implementation arguments \u00b6 Each implementation function must contain the following arguments, which are passed from the API function generate_http_request_code , so it's recommended that you familiarize yourself with the arguments of that function before continuing with this guide because they are well documented there: url : unique positional argument of the function, represents the target URL of the request. headers : dictionary of headers. parameters : list of parameter data objects. files : dictionary of files, only passed to POST requests, so this should not be defined as argument is the function implementation's name is different to post . wrap : maximum anchor of the rendered code snippet. indent : indentation used in the rendered code snippet. quote_char : string quotation character. setup : code snippet prepended to generated request output. teardown : code snippet appended at the end of the generated request output. oneline : if enabled, render the code snippet in one line. seed : seed used generating random fake values of parameters. locale : locale used by faker library for localization of the faked random values for parameters. Method singularities \u00b6 POST \u00b6 Most POST methods implementations render their code snippets different, depending on Content-Types header, including by default some of the most used Content-Types header related behaviours: The default behavior, even if you don't specify it explicitly in the Content-Type header is the generation of an application/x-www-form-urlencoded encoded request. If you want to generate a multipart/form-data encoded request, you need to specify the files to sent using the files argument. If you specifies the Content-Type header application/json , the parameters sent will be adjusted according to the JSON encoded POST request. If you specifies the Content-Type header text/plain , you can only send one parameter and it will be adjusted accordingly following the implementation. One line wrapping behaviour \u00b6 The first thing to take in account (and the most complicated one) is the behaviour of wrapping ( wrap argument) rendering as if oneline=True is passed. The question is: can a snippet of code be outputted in one line if the estimated length of the request is lower than wrap argument value? For example, Python requests can be rendered using this kind of code, in one line: import requests req = requests . get ( 'https://github.com/mondeja/http-request-codegen' ) ...or using multiple lines ( wrap is lower than expected length): import requests req = requests . get ( 'https://github.com/mondeja/http-request-codegen' ) Of course, this also affects parameters , headers and kwargs : import requests req = requests . get ( 'localhost' , params = { 'foo' : 'bar' }, headers = { 'foo' : 'bar' }) ...which can be outputted in multiple lines: import requests req = requests . get ( 'localhost' , params = { 'foo' : 'bar' }, headers = { 'foo' : 'bar' } ) Since this behaviour can depend both oneline and wrap arguments, the recommended way of implement this is to calculate the length of the expected request inside the code snippet, and, if it is greater or equal to wrap argument, must be rendered as if oneline=True . Tip You can see an example of this type of implementation at http_request_codegen.generators.python.requests::get function. But other implementations could be rendered in multiples lines regardless the wrap argument value. For example, the Javascript fetch API implementation will output always a multiline code snippet (unless oneline=True is explicitly defined), because the Javascript Promises writing in single line is not a common syntax and there is a little chance that the generated request could not be wrapped given the default wrap value (80 in this case). The minimum reasonable possible code snippet in one line for Javascript fetch API implementation would be: fetch ( 'localhost' ). then ( function ( response ) {}). catch ( function ( error ) { console . error ( error )}); ...which exceeds the default wrap value length (80). In such type of cases, there is no need of calculate the expected generated code snippet request length before build their output. Tip You can see an example of this type of implementation at http_request_codegen.generators.javascript.fetch::get function. In the first case, you need to iterate over parameters , headers and kwargs arguments to compute the expected length, then compare the expected length with wrap argument value and, if it reaches it, define an internal oneline=True like behaviour. In the second, you can assume that the generated code is multiline unless oneline=True is explicitly defined as argument. Randomizing values \u00b6 The library provides the functions lazy_name_by_parameter and lazy_value_by_parameter which returns the name and the value of a parameter given a parameter dictionary specification. These must be used to randomize parameters in a unified way across implementations as described in generate_http_request_code function documentation. Language/platform utilities \u00b6 You can create an _utils.py module inside a language or platform package to store utilities that could help in the process of building the code snippet, like: Define default indentation for the language/platform ( indent argument). Define default wrapping length value ( wrap argument). Define default quotation character/s ( quote_char argument). Escape quotes of values (according to given quote_char argument). Create greater level functions of code generation for the language/platform, such as string definitions with wrapping behaviour, dictionary definitions... Tip See current _utils.py modules of generators packages as reference. Creating test cases \u00b6 Use the script scripts/create-impl-test-cases.py to create possible generated code snippets cases accordingly to combination of arguments. This will help you developing implementations because saves you the need of execute every possible combination of arguments. Use it as follows: rm -rf cases && python3 scripts/create-impl-test-cases.py \\ --language python \\ --implementation requests \\ --method GET \\ --directory cases Previous command will create a cases/ directory with a lot of code snippets generated, given the combinations described in tests/combinations.py . When you will have manually revised that all code snippets are generated correctly, you can create a test for the implementation at tests/test_generators/test_<lang>/test_<impl>/test_<impl>.py , placing the cases/ directory at tests/test_generators/test_<lang>/test_<impl>/<METHOD> . For example, for Python requests GET method, the test module would be tests/test_generators/test_python/test_requests/test_requests.py and the cases/ directory would be placed at tests/test_generators/test_python/test_requests/GET/ . Tip You can use an already implemented test module as a reference to write the one for the implementation. TODO \u00b6 Implement real server testing for POST requests. Implement Javascript fetch GET.

It's a positive integer in the range 1 to 65536. The maximum value can be defined by optional max attribute. 'random' : Random type between the available types. You can define a set of possible types passing an iterable to types optional parameter attribute. Defined as an iterable or callable, the type will be selected randomly from the iterable, or the returned value from the callable will be used. This allows you to select a random type from a list of custom predefined types. value ( str , iterable , callable ): Parameter value. If not defined and type , values and faker are not defined, the value of the parameter will be a random word built using faker library. Defined as a string, the value will be the string itself. Defined as an iterable, the value will be selected randomly from the iterable. Supports recursivity: until a string is not selected the recursion will not be stopped. Defined as a callable, the value will be the returned value of the callable. Supports recursivity: until a string is returned the recursion will not be stopped. values ( list , iterable , callable ): Possible parameter values. Defined as an iterable, the value will be selected randomly from the iterable. Supports recursivity: until a string is not selected the recursion will not be stopped. Defined as a string, must be a Python formatted module path following the format 'path.to.module::function' and the return value will be used as the value for the parameter, which is useful if choosing a random value from a list doesn't fit your needs. Defined as a callable, the value will be the returned value of the callable. Supports recursivity: until a string is returned the recursion will not be stopped. faker ( str , function ): Python formatted module path to a function of a Faker provider used to build the value randomized. Can be a standard, external provider or any function, but if is not a provider, seed and locale will not have effect. Defined as a string must follow the format 'path.to.provider.module::function' . [] files dict Mapping of files to send to URL. Only has effect for POST methods. If you define this argument, the Content-Type header of the request will be assumed to be 'multipart/form-data' , but only will be explicitly specified in the code generated if the implementation needs it. Each value accepts a string, None or a tuple: Defined as a string, must be the filepath of the file to be sent. Defined as None , the filepath will be randomized using faker.providers.file::file_path function. Defined as a tuple, the first value must be the filepath of the file to be sent (if None will be a randomized filepath), the second value the content-type of the file and the third a dictionary of custom headers for the file. {} wrap int Maximum anchor of the rendered code snippet. If it exceeds it, the rendered code will be conveniently formatted on multiple lines. 80 indent str Indentation string used in the generated code. If not defined, the indentation string commonly used in the implementation will be used. None quote_char str Quotation character for strings used in the generated code. \"'\" setup bool, str If True , includes the code needed by an implementation to perform the request. Could be imports of additional modules or intialization of objects, depends on implementation. You can customize this snippet passing a string with the code snippet that you want to include. None teardown str Code snippet to include after the HTTP request code. None oneline bool Render the code in a single line. False seed int Seed used generating random fake values of parameters. Useful if you want to generate the same set of values between multiples code snippets. None locale str Locale used by faker library for localization of the faked random values for parameters. None Exceptions: Type Description ValueError Value is not a valid value in their context. TypeError Values does not complaint with the types supported for it.
